# LudumDare2021

This repo contains all the source of our submission to the Ludum Dare 48, which theme was "Deeper and Deeper"

Our Game is called Hole, and can be played at this link: https://maximegammaitoni.itch.io/hole

You're playing a monster that's been locked up in a tower, and you need to pass through disgusting holes to reach the bottom. 
For this you need to dash through glass switches to open the hole, while avoiding the death traps in your path. We measure how long it takes you to reach the bottom.

We were 4 developers, 1 3D artists and 1 Composer to work on that project for the 72h of the jam.
